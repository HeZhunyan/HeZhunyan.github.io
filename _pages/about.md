Welcome to my homepage!  
I am currently a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Finance at Wenzhou-Kean University. Although my academic background is in business, I have a strong passion for computer science and its applications in financial technology (FinTech) and medical robotics.  

My interests span a variety of interdisciplinary areas, including photoacoustic probe design, photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging and reconstruction, and the development of medical robots guided by imaging. I am particularly curious about the design and control of continuum robots for navigation and operation in narrow anatomical environments.  

I enjoy exploring how engineering and computational techniques can enhance both financial systems and healthcare technologies.



## Research Interests
Photoacoustic probe design
Photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging, image reconstruction
Medical robots based on photoacoustic/ultrasound image guidance
Continuous robot mechanism design for use in narrow spaces in the body, kinematic/dynamic control
